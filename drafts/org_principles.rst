General Principles for an Open Source  Code of Conduct organization
===================================================================

1.    **Education over Enforcement**
      
      Prioritize education on issues of inclusion and diversity, rather than trying to enforce a particular Code of Conduct or social standard.  

2.    **Resources over Regulation**
      
      Provide resources rather than rules. Model Codes of Conduct, reporting structures, and a community of knowledgeable experts will allow projects to establish the rules and regulations to manage themselves.

3.    **Reporting over Shaming**
      
      Provide safe, neutral places for abuse to be reported either anonymously or publicly, and provide expertise in taking serious issues to local law enforcement. Reports must be visible, accurate and provided in an atmosphere free of bias and agenda.

4.    **Reputation over Punishment**
      
      Focus on transparency and visibility, not on punishing bad actors. It is not our place to police the culture of a project, but to allow projects to establish a clear and visible reputation that gives new contributors a clear idea of what that culture is.
