OSDII
=====

This repository was created following discussions that began at the Google
Summer of Code 2014 Reunion.

That converstaion is [documented here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10pa7OuY1KT0HyAa-vBmjiKBcW9NRjoeSpkEqJ6rd2D0/edit?usp=sharing).

The conversation has continued in [a Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osdii).

The hope is that this repository will soon contain drafts of some kind of
Statement on Diversity and Inclusion that Open-Source projects can "sign on" to
as a commitment to fostering welcoming cultures that embrace diversity and
prevent harrassment.
